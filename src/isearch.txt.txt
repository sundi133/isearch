Problem 2.

These program includes two heristics
	a. h1: heuristic one   : one heuristic is to use the euclidian distance between two slide positions from its current position to its goal state.There will be 7 goal states here. The heuristic has to be calculated for each of the goal states.


	b. h2: heuristic second: second heuristic is to use the number of misplaced tiles heuristic of its current position and its goal state.This heuristic has to calculated for each of the goal state and the minimum of them has to be taken.

The cost of both the heuristics are printed in the end along with the path.

when at each step max(h1,h2) is chosen the perfomance moves up even higher.
